## CODING_PRACTICES

### Guidelines for DOCUMENTATION

#### TYPEDOC

- Use JSDoc-style comments with TypeScript-specific annotations for all public APIs
- Configure custom themes to match {{project_branding}} for consistent documentation
- Group related functionality using @module and @category tags for better organization
- Document edge cases and error handling for {{critical_functions}}
- Generate and publish documentation as part of the CI/CD pipeline to keep it current
- Include usage examples for complex interfaces and abstract classes
